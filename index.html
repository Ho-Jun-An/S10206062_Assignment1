            <p>
                My name is Ho Jun An, and this site is my portfolio where I will be showcasing 
                all of my sketches, digital art and other artwork that I have worked on over the 
                years. I am still creating more and more all the time, so new pieces will be added
                here and on my Instagram page to show.
