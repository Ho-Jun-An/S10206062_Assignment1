                My name is Ho Jun An, and this site is my portfolio where I will be showcasing 
                all of my sketches, digital art and other artwork that I have worked on over the 
                years. I am still creating more and more all the time, so new pieces will be added
                here and on my Instagram page to show.

                In addition to my artistic talents, I also have a passion for game design, and have
                experience with Python and C#, and have also made games in other medium. Furthermore,
                I also often practice on my worldbuilding skills and have been doing it constantly.
                Being a game developer has always been one of my interests in life, and I would be
                thrilled if I was ever given an opportunity to get a position as one.
